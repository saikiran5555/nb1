    "Bayes' theorem, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence or information. The theorem is expressed mathematically as follows:\n",

    "In simple terms, Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis in light of new evidence. It's widely used in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, for tasks such as Bayesian inference, spam filtering, and medical diagnosis."
